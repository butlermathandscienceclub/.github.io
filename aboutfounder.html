      <h1>About the founder</h1>
      <p>Kellan Butler is a kid who lives in Florida. He made this club so kids and adults like him can share their ideas and findings. Also, he hopes he will
       inspire people to learn about science. In Kellan's garage he has a small, wooden work bench known as his "laboratory". It isn't really a laboratory, just a place
        where he keeps his chemistry sets and safety equipment and preforms demonstrations. He specilizes in chemistry, but he likes all types science. When he was a little kid, about 2 years old, he
         got a snap circut kit. Now, he has a more advanced set. He has always wanted to know how everything works. He has bult model rockets and launched them, but he
          stopped because he dosn't have a launch site. He sometimes plays football for exersize</p>
